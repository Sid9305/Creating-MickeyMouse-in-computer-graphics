# Creating-MickeyMouse-in-computer-graphics
We have created Mickey Mouse using "graphics.h" library

By using the ".cpp" extension while writing the code in the syntax of the C language, we have found a way to leverage the features of the "graphics.h" library.

It is important to note that in order to run your project, we will need an IDE or compiler that supports the "graphics.h" package. This library provides built-in functions specifically designed for creating various shapes, including ovals, lines, and circles, which we have utilized to bring Mickey Mouse to life.

However, it's worth mentioning that the "graphics.h" library is not a standard library in C or C++. It was popularly used in the past, particularly with the Turbo C++ compiler for DOS. Therefore, modern IDEs or compilers may not have built-in support for this library.
